<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research focuses on designing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors on FPGA using Chisel and Verilog. The goal is to develop a flexible architecture adaptable to various parameters, such as parallelism, radix, and point size. Besides, I have published two patents and one conference paper related to FFT processor design.

I  am passionate about cutting-edge technology and highly self-motivated to push my limits when facing significant challenges. Moreover, I  enjoy sharing knowledge through open-source contributions and writing blogs on engineering techniques recording the solutions to complicated problems.üòá
