<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research currently focuses on designing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors on FPGA using Chisel and Verilog. The goal is to develop a flexible architecture adapted to various parameters such as parallelism, radix, and point.
I have published 2 patents and 1 conference paper related to the FFT research field.


I am deeply passionate about cutting-edge technology 
and highly self-motivated to challenge myself when facing serious obstacles. 
Moreover, I like to share technology via open-source and write blogs related to 
engineering techniques.
